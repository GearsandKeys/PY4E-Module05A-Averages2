Exercise 2 for iterations from PY4E

# Assignment
Exercise 2: Write another program that prompts for a list of numbers
as above and at the end prints out both the maximum and minimum of
the numbers instead of the average. (You can use your previous code as starter code)

Enter a number: 4

Enter a number: 5

Enter a number: bad data

Invalid input

Enter a number: 7

Enter a number: done

16 3 7 4

## Note: The end  of the code should look something like this (but with max and min instead of average):
```
print(total, count, average) 
```
