# Assignment
Exercise 2: Write another program that prompts for a list of numbers
as above and at the end prints out both the maximum and minimum of
the numbers instead of the average. (You can use your previous code as starter code)

# Starter Code
Use your code from assignment 1

# Expected Output
```
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: bad data
Invalid input
Enter a number: 7
Enter a number: done

16 3 7 4
```

## Note: 
The end  of the code should look something like this (but with max and min instead of average):

```
print(<total> <count> <max> <min>) 
```

## Test
When you think your code is ready, run `pytest` in the terminal!
